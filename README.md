# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
The project i have created predicts heart disease using Python and machine learning models. It processes health data to train and evaluate models like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, KNN, MLP, and SVM.

## Getting Started
Follow all the instructions for setting up and run the project in any local machines which support the versions i am adding below.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher versions
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Installing
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anjiunnam/HeartDiseasePrediction.git
   
2. Installing required dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   
3. Navigate to project directory
   ```bash
   cd HeartDiseasePrediction
   
4. Run the code which i used for testing 
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Assignment3_1200-Inroduction to Data Analysis.ipynb

### Breakdown of Tests
   
   - Model Training: Models used for training on the heart disease dataset are Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, KNN, MLP, and SVM.
   - Model Evaluation/Metrics: Measures accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Visualization: Plots feature importance and performance metrics.

### Deployment
   This project can be deployed on platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud using FastAPI for    the backend.
